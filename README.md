# 📚 Library Management System (C++ | DSA-Based)

This project is a command-line **Library Management System** implemented in **C++**, showcasing the practical use of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** such as **Linked Lists, Tries, Hash Maps, Stacks**, and **Queues**. The system simulates real-world library operations like managing books, handling borrow/return requests, maintaining user histories, and searching for books by title prefix.

## 🚀 Features

- 📘 **Book Management**
  - Add, remove, and display books using a **Linked List**
  - Store and manage book attributes (ID, title, author, genre, availability)

- 🔍 **Book Search by Title Prefix**
  - Implemented using a **Trie** data structure for efficient prefix-based lookups

- 🧾 **Borrow & Return Functionality**
  - Tracks borrowed books using **Hash Maps**
  - Handles book waitlisting with **Queues**

- 📜 **User Borrowing History**
  - Maintains a borrowing history per user using **Stacks**

- 🔒 **Modular Design**
  - Organized into clean header/source files (OOP principles)
  - Easy to maintain and extend
